# Nulib

Nulib is a convenience library for Ocaml, currently mostly geared
towards scripting and improvised programs

## LICENSE NOTICE

Nulib is released under GPL3, see section LICENSE in README.md and the
LICENSE in the top directory of the source tree.

## What is it?
## INSTALLING

You need to have lsd-base2 installed (see
https://github.com/m-e-leypold/lsd-base2). Then just type 'make
install' in the top directory of Nulib. As in lsd-base2,
Nulib will be "live" installed, that is, hooked under
~/.scripts.

A better (packagable) installation process will be forthcoming (some
time, but certainly be sped up if people actually using this).
